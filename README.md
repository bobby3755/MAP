# MAP: Multi Analysis Pipeline

MAP (Multi Analysis Pipeline) is a powerful graphical user interface designed for DORA (DNA Origami Rotor Analysis), specifically developed for use by the Pallav Kosuri Lab. This tool facilitates fast data parsing of single molecule fluorescence times series data, enabling efficient analysis and visualization.

## Installation for users internal to Kosuri Lab

To install MAP, please follow these steps:

1. Download the source code folder from this GitHub repository.
2. Put the file in any directory on the /D: drive. It does not need to be in the same folder as any data because the GUI can navigate to it. 
3. Open Anaconda Command Prompt as an administrator.
4. Activate the "origami" environment by executing the following command:

```shell
   conda activate origami
```

4. Navigate to the directory where you have stored the downloaded the "src" folder, and navigate into that folder. Note: you should see main.py by running "ls" in the terminal to list all files.
6. Run the following command to start the application:

```shell
   python main.py
```

Please note that MAP requires the "origami" environment to be activated in order to run successfully.
